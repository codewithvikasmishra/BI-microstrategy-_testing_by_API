# BI-microstrategy-_testing_by_API
Microstrategy dashboards/dossiers/chapter testing through API's

You should have a good idea about microstrategy that how it works. What are the components available in microstrategy like dossiers, documents, dashboards etc.

To make it easy it would be good if you have API testing tool is available with you so you can feel the schema of output. Also, you should have some basic knowledge with json schema and how you can call the key and values from there in python.

We can also test the BI-dashboards by selenium, but i followed this approach.
